# Simple-Particle-Simulator

## Description:
This is a simple particle simulator I made using the love2D game engine without using external any libraries or API's. I made this to learn more complex LUA coding and to have fun.

This simulator can simulate some simple particles and their interactions like steam, sand, gas, fire and more.

## Instructions:

* For windows: Download and open SPS.rar. Execute SPS.exe
* For Mac: Comming soon...
* For Linux: Comming soon...
