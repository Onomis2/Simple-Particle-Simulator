# Simple-Particle-Simulator

## Description:
This is a simple particle simulator I made using the love2D game engine without using external any libraries or API's. I made this to learn more complex LUA coding and to have fun.

## Instructions:

1. Install love2d if it is not yet installed and make sure it is located somewhere where you can find it.
2. Unzip particle.zip into a folder.
3. Drag said folder onto love2d.exe.

## Wiki:

Keybinds:
Mouse left click: Place particles
Mouse right click: Erase particles
Scroll: Size up and down
1 - 9: Select particle
R: Reset entire canvas

List of particles:
1. Concrete?
2. Water
3. Sand
4. Gas
5. Steam
6. Fire

## To-Do list:

- [ ] Make a file structure to regain readability
- [x] Make better comments in code
- [ ] Optimise performance
- [ ] Add pixel size
