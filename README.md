# Simple-Particle-Simulator

## Description:
This is a simple particle simulator I made using the love2D game engine without using external any libraries or API's. I made this to learn more complex LUA coding and to have fun.

This simulator can simulate some simple particles and their interactions like steam, sand, gas, fire and more.

## Instructions:

* For windows: Download and open SPS.rar. Execute SPS.exe
* For Mac: Comming soon...
* For Linux: Comming soon...

## Keybinds:
Mouse left click: Place particles
Mouse right click: Erase particles
Scroll: Size up and down
1 - 9: Select particle
R: Reset entire canvas
space: Pause/Unpause
.: Simulate a single frame when paused

List of particles:
1. Concrete?
2. Water
3. Sand
4. Gas
5. Steam
6. Fire
7. Wood

## To-Do list:

- [x] Make a file structure to regain readability 
- [x] Make better comments in code
- [x] Optimise performance 2
- [x] Add pixel size 
- [x] Release executable file 
- [x] Visible and centered cursor
- [x] UI rework
- [ ] Selectable particles from UI
- [ ] Selectable categories from UI
- [ ] Selectable options from UI
